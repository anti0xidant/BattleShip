Blackjack Counting
Difficulty: 2

The game of Blackjack has very simple rules: players should take cards one by one trying to collect more points than opponents, but not exceeding 21 (refer Wikipedia for complete rules).

The deck contains all cards from 2 to 10 inclusive, which are counted according to their value, also Kings, Queens and Jacks which cost 10 points each and also Aces, which could be counted as 1 or 11 points, whatever is better.

Let us learn the programming of scoring algorithm for such game.

Each test-case consists of several cards expressed with symbols:
	2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
	T, J, Q, K, A - for 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace

Answer should contain the number of points in each test-case, not exceeding 21 - or the word Bust if the total is greater than 21 (i.e. player immediately loss).
