Create class definitions for employees in an organization.  Each employee may or may not have a manager.  One employee may have many subordinates.  This can grow up to any level. 

The class should be able to:

* Find all the subordinates for a given employee at any level (ex: the CEO should return all employees) 
* Find the manager details of an employee (null if no manager). 

Assumptions: 
* Employee contains 
	ID: int (Unique) 
	Name: string 

* One employee can have only one manager.
