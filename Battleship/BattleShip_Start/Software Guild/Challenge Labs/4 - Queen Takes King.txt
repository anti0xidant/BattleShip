Queen Takes King
Difficulty: 4

Programming of game playing algorithms, like Chess, have two principal tasks:

 1. Assessing position, at least by checking which pieces could be taken;
 2. Constructing a kind of minimax algorithm to select a move leading to position with best value.

We're not going to create the whole game of Chess... let us start by solving a simpler problem:

There is a chessboard with 8 x 8 squares. The only pieces are the White King and Black Queen. Check whether the Queen could take the King.

If you are unfamiliar with Chess, a Queen can move to any distance vertically, horizontally or along any of two diagonals.

See these two examples, with schematically drawn boards. On both the King is shown with letter K while marks Q shows variants of placing the Queen.

On the left scheme the King (b4) could be taken by any of the four Queens (vertical queen b8, diagonal d2, diagonal e7, horizontal g4);
On the right scheme the King is in safe position - none of the four Queens can move to take him.

Notice how the squares of the board are addressed. Columns (files) are marked with letters from a to h, while rows (called ranks) are marked with digits from 1 to 8. So the King on the left diagram sits on the b4 square - and on the right diagram on the f2. We shall use this notation.

Write test cases to evaluate King and Queen placement, by specifying their coordinates (King's first).

Answer should give only letter Y or N for each of test-cases, meaning that King could be taken or not respectively. Separate letters with spaces.

Example:

input data:
b4 b8
b4 e7
b4 d2
b4 g4
f2 b1
f2 c4
f2 d5
f2 g7

answer:
Y Y Y Y N N N N

In this example the positions are taken from both of diagrams above - cases 1..4 from the left diagram and others from the right.
